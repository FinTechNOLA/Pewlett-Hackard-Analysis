## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview
This project provided a deeper analysis of critical retirement data for Pewlett-Hackard employees. By utilizing SQL and multiple personnel databases, I was able to provide both a new database of retiring employees by title as well as a tailored list of current employees eligible for a proposed mentorship program. These new databases will provide a valuable tool for employee development and talent retention.

# Results
There are four major points that arose in my analysis which may be of significant interest:
- Nearly 26,000 Senior Engineers are eligible for retirement
- Nearly 25,000 Senior Staff are also eligible for retirement
- 25% of the current workforce is eligible for retirement
- Only 1549 employees are within the eligible pool for the mentorship program

# Summary

Over 72,458 employees have reached the retirement age in a company of over 300k employees. This amounts to nearly 25% of the current workforce eligible for retirement and a significant threat to the institutional knowledge of the company. Only 1549 employees meet the criteria for the proposed mentorship roles, however the company will need significantly more mentors to help transfer the knowledge held by these eligible retirees.
